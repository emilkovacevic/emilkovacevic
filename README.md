- 👋 Hi, My name is Emil Kovacevic
- :books: I am a self taught web developer 
- 👀 I’m interested in web development with React and other technologies which go together with React
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the full MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate all sorts of web apps.
     I am open for an opportunity to work with a team that runs on clear communication. I want to align myself with a team of developers I believe in and where I can create positive change. I am always looking to learn more and am open to taking on challenging projects.
